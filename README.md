WebSocket Flash Fallback Client
===============================

The test-client.html tests if your browser supports WebSocket natively. If not it dynamically loads the necessary files to support fallback to Flash. 
I have used the necessary support files from this repository -> https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js
